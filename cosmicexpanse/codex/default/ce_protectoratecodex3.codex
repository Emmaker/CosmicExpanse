"- The Matter Manipulator is not omnipotent. Digging takes time, building has a limited range, and wiring is not immediately accessible due to the Matter Manipulator's limited power supply. The power supply can be expanded, increasing the strength of the Matter Manipulator and unlocking more functionality, but this costs Manipulator Modules, which are rare and must be sourced by the owner of the Matter Manipulator rather than the Terrene Protectorate.",

Particularly heavy elements, or particles with very complex structures can be difficult, if not outright impossible for the Matter Manipulator to manipulate. Unofficial modifications may claim to be able to change this, however these are not sanctioned by the Terrene Protectorate and damaged Matter Manipulators will cost pixels to replace.
